                            <p>As my name is <i>Mahmuda</i> which means praisable(প্রশংসনীয়), i often get praised for my works. Which means I am detail oriented and the things I try to do is mostly get praised. (End of bragging)</p>

I want to enjoy every bits of it one day if i am lucky enough. Love to capture the beautiful moments and sceneries with my camera. </p>
